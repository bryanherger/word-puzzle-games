Word Scramble Game

Play: five or size letter tiles are arranged to the left and the player then makes all possible words in rows on the right.  Puzzle letters and solutions are defined in and randomly selected from data/puzzles.json.  Puzzles are generated from the word lists in the "python" folder by Python scripts in the same folder. 

Implemented as HTML/Javascript application for Cordova.  It doesn't use any Cordova plugins so it would probably work on a web server if the files were arranged right.

Files:
- www/ HTML, JS, CSS
- data/ JSON file of puzzles
- python/ scripts and lists used to generate puzzles
