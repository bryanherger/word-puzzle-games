Word Puzzle Games

This is a set of games I am developing for my primary school aged kids.  I am building them with Cordova with the intent that they can be played in a browser online, or as standalone iOS or Android apps.
The goal is to have a completely free, as in no cost, no ads, no tracking, option for educational games.  I will release under new BSD license so the games and any resources like spelling lists can be freely reused.

Game list:

Word Scramble: Find all the words that can be spelled with the five or six tiles.

More to come...
